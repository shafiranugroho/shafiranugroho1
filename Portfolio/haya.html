		<h5>00 |  Introduction</h5>
		<h6>This project aims to reconstruct our perception of E-Commerce sites. Targeted towards teenagers, this reconstructed e-commerce site “Haya” aims to satisfy one’s craving for adventure and comfort by providing its users with the option to personalize their online-shopping experience through different categories of “adventures”. The project’s process included requirements of website design and developmen. Prior to the design cycle, I was assigned to investigate the industry through surveys, card-sorting, interviews and competitive analysis. This knowledge was able to construct possible user personas, stories and flows. Into the design cycle, I designed Haya from wireframes to typeface selection, etc. Essentially reaching the point of development of the live prototype of the application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

		<h5>00 |  Competitive Analysis & Personas</h5>
		<h6>Understanding the market is essential for a new platform, especially with features that are similar to others. As an E-commerce website, Haya’s competitors included applications or brands like Zalando, Zara, Dolls Kills, and Urban Outfitters. The competitive analysis deduced that users value: 
			<ul>
				<li>A responsive design that betters accessibility across various devices and systems,</li>
				<li>Interactive and personalization features,</li>
				<li>Differentiation,</li>
				<li>Trend or News features,</li>
			</ul>

		<h6>Inspired by ‘AirBnB’s activity search system as well as Topshop’s in-store personalized shopping experience,  personalization were constructed by the “Adventure” feature. The personas challenged a specific investigation in the different types of teens, in order to build a personalization feature within the site. With personalization comes comfort; whilst introducing a new contrsuct to the generic build, the feature adds the demanded ‘adventure-like’ sensation. The chosen themes or “Adventures” are: The Climb, Concrete Jungle, and Ocean Bliss.  After many interview sessions, it is noted that the targeted users of teenagers are excited by a sense of adventure and fear to miss out on trendy experiences. This perspective led to the name “Haya” which in Hebrew and Arabic translates to Alive and/or Life, which captures the experience offered by the site. The name further foreshadows the site’s lifelike experience through a personalization feature that gives users the option to shop within their choice of “life Adventure”. Once an adventure is selected, the user is redirected towards a specific page that features trends and recommended styles of the selected theme - continuing the key of personalization. Additional differentiation feature lies within the site’s “trends” page that offers users to browse through trending outfits and offers them a chance to mimic the photographed outfit.</h6>
