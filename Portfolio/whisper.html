		<h5>00 |  Introduction</h5>
		<h6>The basis of the pieces in this IB Art exhibition is the unifying idea of “The Voiceless”. Through the exhibition, I aim to discover and expose how different individuals experience varying forms of suppression of their individuality, the causes of this silencing and finally the impact of this suppression on each individual. Realistically, I believe that behind every person’s smile is a story and a journey filled with its ups and downs that is often times suppressed under a facade. I used the technique of fragmentation or distortion through strokes, line-work, and color clashing in order to portray the absurdity of suppressing one’s individuality. In extension, pieces may allude to our vast world, with a growing population, where communication is often fragmented and broken, misinterpreted and masked. The main aim of this project is to create a voice, an opportunity, to express and inform the community about the true emotions held hidden and masked within voiceless individuals. Essentially pieces will stimulate various moods amongst the audience depending on their own individual life stories</h6>

		<h5>01 |  The Voices - December 2016</h5>
		<h6><p> 50cm x 80 </p> Those who are voiceless are rich with voices. The linework connects and gathers the many suppressed voices within a single individual, and the curves of the lines between the faces suggest its flexibility. However suppression adds pressure and the tough-flexibility would eventually collapse and break through in red-rage. The piece depicts the consequences of being voiceless like fear, concerns, anger and their eventual escape from their condition and absorb the identity of the voiceless person. </h6>

		<h5>02 |  Take a Turn - February 2017</h5>
		<h6><p> 40cm x 80 </p> Life is complex because each individual tackle challenges differently, and through its simplicity the piece aims to capture our lives. The piece aims to engage the viewers in a journey through a maze, which subsequently stimulates a viewer’s thought process. Whether consciously or not the piece acts as a platform that stimulates our thought process, our different paths, our decision-making strategy to reach a focus point, only to escape into another maze, another journey. </h6>

		<h5>03 |  A Woman's Speech - September 2015</h5>
		<h6><p> 35cm x 40 </p> Mixed Media - We grow up with the words, “think before you speak”, and yet most wise words of the soft-spoken, processed through this rule, are overpowered by the power of the shouts. And then they will say, “boys will be boys”. This piece highlights the emerging empowerment of women in recent years, as it shines bravery and righteous power through its accentuated, distorted visual imagery. </h6>

		<h5>04 |  Deep Water - September 2017 </h5>
		<h6><p> 50cm x 50 </p> Acrylic - Some say that before you die, your life flashes before your eyes; at this time, you are both helpless yet in peace. Such precious moments, some try to stimulate these by submerging into water, just enough to cancel the noise outside. This silence offers a time of clarity that sets your thoughts free. This piece shows the reverse of societal suppression upon a person, instead it shows the silencing of society to let one’s mind roam free. In the short moment of silence your voice is heard.</h6>

		<h5>05 |  Pacifier - October 2016 </h5>
		<h6><p> 100cm x 200 x 100 </p> Head cast installation - To grow up is to follow the rules, to be wise is to learn from being free. By human nature we strive to succeed. For many years, success is closely associated to one's economical state.  Blinded by the desire of success, many perceive importance in only their job, whilst they silence the rest of the world. Ironically the world has pacified them into a perception to follow a routine. Here, the sculpture’s unifying  physical similarity pacifies their true motivation in life.</h6>
